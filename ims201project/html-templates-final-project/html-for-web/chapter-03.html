<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>

<p>
In an age where the world and it’s technology is becoming vastly more mobile, this paper will discuss whether or not security is keeping up with this rapidly changing space. It begins with discussing the prevalence and change of technology towards mobile in recent years. This includes a variety of technologies and innovations including cell phones, watches, blue tooth devices, wireless networks, and laptops in a variety of settings including both the everyday life of the average consumer, and when used in corporate environments. Next we will be looking into modern security threats on both mobile and stationary technology, and threats mobile devices can pose to secure networks, primarily through backdoor access and ignorance on a user whose device is infected. Finally we will venture into what needs to happen for mobile security in the future, and what we can do now to ensure our devices and data in this increasing mobile world are secure. The paper concludes with some final thoughts on the topic, as well as summarizing just how secure our mobile use really is.

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>
The year is 1941. Germany is planning an invasion on Greece while Italy plans for the Battle of Cape Matapan. With advanced German technology and Cryptography, using their Enigma machines, they have successfully managed to communicate without the allies knowing for years. As Germans would have it, their Enigma machines were “unbreakable” and managed to use these machines to send messages for battlefield, naval, and diplomatic communications. Unfortunately for them though, it was not unbreakable. Allied forces soon cracked the code discovering plans and evidence that Germany was attacking Greece, Italy’s battle plans for Cape Matapan, and later even gained in advantage in North Africa using these deciphered messages (History Channel). This turned the tide of World War 2 and eventually helped lead to the victory of the Allies, and this also marked a new era of Cyber Security. Where not everything you write is private, and not everything you save is secure no matter how complex of an encryption or safeguard you use.</p>

<h3>SECURITY IN THE MODERN ERA</h3>
<p>
It’s been over half a decade since the Germans sent messages using their “unbreakable” Enigma Machines, and the technology field has changed dramatically. Most systems online in the modern era use a form of cryptography to protect user data, such as Blowfish Encryption Algorithms, MD5, and also SHA1 to name a few. Along with more advanced encryption, this technology has become increasingly mobile and more pervasive in today’s culture, leading to more opportunities and access points for interception of important information or data.
A few examples of mobile technology that has security could include smartphones, tablets, PDA’s, smart-watches, iPods, Google Glass, Laptops, Game Systems, and even your car. All of these have security measures in place, but as with the German Enigma code, no system is entirely fool proof from intrusion.
In 2013, Forbes produced an article discussing a recent hack by Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek showing a recent attack the two created on cars, the cars being attacked were a Ford Escape and Toyata Prius. Using their laptop, these two were able to ultimately control a car and end a person’s life if they had malicious intentions. They were able to take control of the cars steering wheels and brakes, stopping you from controlling your car and potentially putting a driver into a dangerous situation such as driving into oncoming traffic in a busy intersection (Forbes.com).
Another research paper recently published by the University of Michigan found it was quite easy to hack into the street light system using only their laptop and the right kind of radio. Effectively being able to turn all lights to green, or red, and cause traffic on the roads potentially creating several fatal car accidents with the click of a button (University of Michigan).
Not to mention the several hacking attempts and successes at major corporations such as Target and JPMorgan, computer security has become a hot topic and can affect all of us. Today a hacker can hack into your car and run you off the road, break into your bank account and steal money, steal your identity over the internet and hold it for ransom, or do something as petty as stealing your Facebook Account and spamming your friends.

<h3>MOBILE SECURITY THREATS</h3>

<p>
In today’s modern era, there are a variety of threats to mobile security. These range from “Man In The Middle Attacks” to simply stealing a phone and accessing it’s information, and can have a wide range of consequences. Along with these several threats in mobile security, it’s also important to understand just how many consumers in the world are using the internet, and by how much it is increasing every day. Figure 1-1 below shows that the percentage of Americans and the world is steadily increasing every year, and that the world as a whole is mostly connected to the internet. As the world slowly plugs into the internet it not only increases the amount of information that can be found, it also increases the number of malicious users and increases the amount of money that can be stolen. In 2013, ic3 reported that over 781 million dollars in property had been lost over the internet due to malicious activity. (Ic3)

<p>
Recently an attack was launched on a variety of celebrities, primarily all female, that exposed nude photos of them that was retrieved from their iCloud accounts. For many that use this service every day, they were surprised that such a thing could happen. Apple itself is one of the largest tech companies in America, and has some of the brightest software engineers working for them at their home location.</p>

<p>
The actual fault was in both the user’s security questions and password strength, but some of the blame is actually Apple’s as well. A recent Github repository contains code that queries Apple’s iCloud services via the “Find My iPhone” API to guess the username and password of a user, and they are not limited in the number of queries they can use in succession (Forbes, iCloud Data Breach). While this may seem trivial to many of those in the field and classified as a rookie mistake, these kinds of bugs and security holes are prevalent in the Software systems of today.</p>

<p>
The reason these holes exist in software can happen for a variety of reasons. More often than not, it’s simply looking over a simple feature that leads to a small security flaw in the system such as the case was with the “Find My iPhone” API. Modern day software engineers have to be perfect with their code and test conditions, while hackers only have to find one weakness to exploit a system. In businesses and applications where literally millions of lines of code exist, it is nearly impossible to prevent any and all bugs that may come up in a system and have it be in a cost and time effective manner.
</p>

<p>
  A slightly different issue with mobile technology in the world of today also deals with businesses allowing its’ employees to access its’ network infrastructure with personal devices and using laptops both at and out of work in the workplace.
</p>

<p>
By having these BYOD policies (Bring Your Own Device) and allowing unmanaged devices to connect to this infrastructure, it has the potential for infected devices to spread it’s infections to others. Whether it’s unintentional by not keeping up-to-date with software or an accidental confrontation with malware, once given access to the network it can then spread and become pervasive within the network. This then allows the malware tons of capabilities such as stealing user data, destroying records, breaking PC’s, and ultimately causing havoc within a company’s most important systems (Microsoft, BYOD Environments).
</p>

<h3>Protecting Ourselves in the Modern Era </h3>

<p>
  With all of these potential points where a modern day consumer can be exposed to malicious software and be negatively impacted, there are only a few things that one can do. Firstly, every consumer must be aware of security threats and how breaches can happen. Consumers must also actively be on the lookout for suspicious programs and activity on their devices, to prevent these infections being spread to others.
</p>

<p>
  It’s also important that when using the everyday internet, we do not click malicious links or give sensitive information through technology unless it is absolutely necessary. UC San Diego has a page on their website entirely dedicated to educating it’s students on the topic of malware and how one gets it, as well as how to fix it (UC San Diego). If a computer is running slower than normal, has frequent ad pop ups, email/Facebook spamming friends through your accounts, or you notice your information has been hijacked and used elsewhere in general, there is a good chance your computer has been infected. In order to prevent infection, make sure you keep up with updates and stay away from peer to peer services such as Bittorrent or Limewire, and as mentioned above, be wary of what links you click on, on the internet and what you download as well. Lastly, make sure you have a competent and well respected anti-virus that will keep your machine clean and virus free.
