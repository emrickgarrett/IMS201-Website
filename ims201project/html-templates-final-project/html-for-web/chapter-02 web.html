<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>

<p>This chapter explores the impact the development of mobile technology has had on business conduct in a global, private, and personal sense. Containing the information, resources, skills, and markets of the entire world to handheld devices has broken the chains of inopportunity for countless citizens of the world, business-minded and otherwise. This containment of information has, in turn, freed any individual with access to mobile technology to roam the geography of the physical world with the confidence of having the rest of the world and his or her peers at their fingertips. An explosion of innovation has since blossomed out of the sheer volume of opportunity now made available for businesses to communicate with one another, as well as with their competitors and target markets.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Imagine giving every person in the world every tool in the world; access to any education, any research, any <em>human</em> out there. Any work environment efficiently compressed into the palm of your hand, able to be taken anywhere, making the ability to bring ideas to life limitless. Developing countries are now able to grow an economy starting with individual citizens, and interact in business dealings all over the world. Not only have mobile information and communication technologies spread business around the world, but they have also innovated the way in which it is conducted. Technical support is now virtually synonymous with customer service, and business has redefined itself to meet these standards. </p>
<h3>Changing Business Markets </h3>
<p>Mobile information and communication technology (ICT) has been making major changes in the business sector of the world ever since it became a prevalent reality in &lsquo;human&rsquo; interaction in the late 2000s. Development of these technologies started much earlier than this, but it was not until the Internet and mobile telephones were successfully incorporated into developed countries that the technology became an integral part of business conduct. Strategically, the workforce needs to make considerations in not only how quickly they adopt new mobile technologies, but also simply how they use these technologies, as a mismanaged tech support system can serve to be more damaging than outdated technology (Basole). Blindly adopting technology to replace conventional means of business is not a successful concept, as there is not always a justification for the investment based off of the results it yields. &ldquo;The theory of task-technology fit (TTF) suggests that a match between business tasks and technology is important to explain and predict use and performance impacts&rdquo; (Gebauer 102).  The sheer volume of information existing today makes the global market both more informed and more challenging than ever before. The reality is that, at one time, businesses could easily identify their markets and competitors, and instead now have countless factors to be considered far out of immediate reach. This calls for business intelligence – analysis of quantifiable information in order to better make decisions and affect the model of business to be most effective (Hyek). These new models can account for the explosion of mobile payment systems that have taken business by storm in the past year alone. Mobile systems like these now make it possible for friends to pass payments along to one another while sitting in a restaurant, and for a landlord to be collecting his monthly rent while other running errands at the grocery store. Time, convenience, It is generally found that technological-based service firms, like those that accept e-payments and those that found their conception in mobile technology, outperform companies that arc primarily selling their personal technical <em>capabilities</em>. Entrepreneurs and their companies that are steeply involved in&nbsp;technology&nbsp;share several growth characteristics that can actually inhibit their success, however, particularly in the marketing of their products/services (Stoica). This inhibition can be attributed to the fact that it is difficult for companies of this type to identify (and therefore, make marketable) their core values outside of modernity and efficiency, as they have nearly always existed online. This speaks to the diversity of mobile technology, and the broad spectrum to which it can be applied and even misapplied.   </p>

<h3>International Opportunities</h3>

<p>Mobile technology, particularly pertaining to communication, has created global markets in areas of the world where none existed previously. It is estimated that more than 56% of the population in Africa now own a mobile phone, providing hand-held gateways to this multinational world of commerce and business interaction <br />
  (Wall). Not only does this present the opportunity for education, but these newly accessible populations now posses the capability of fostering personal businesses, interacting in stock markets, behaving as online consumers, and sharing ideas for innovating and invigorating existing global business efforts. The continuing development of mobile technology has had an indelible impact on the entire continent of Africa. In an area of the world where consistent access to electricity is patchy at best, technologies that can be transported and used in a practical manner offer a sort of travelling infrastructure where none had existed previously. An integration of industries seems to be an inevitable reality in the near future, and those working in the field of mobile technology and business platforms foresee a near complete convergence of private business, economy, and even geography once the world of mobile technology becomes the standard interaction.</p>
