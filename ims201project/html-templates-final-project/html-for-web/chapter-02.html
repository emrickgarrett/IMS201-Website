<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>

<p>
In response to a growing body of literature in writing studies and education that sounds a call for new models of assessment for today’s digital texts, this chapter offers an adaptable model for the assessment of new media composition in the writing classroom. I begin with a brief survey of literature that provides a rationale and lays a foundation for the assessment model, and then present the model, which draws specifically from three assessment frameworks espoused by Paul Allison (2009), Eve Bearne (2009), and Michael Neal (2011). The model places value on both <em>composition process and product</em>, requires students to be involved in assessment through setting their own goals and participating in guided reflection, and offers students adaptable language to describe new media composition process and product. The chapter concludes with several videos that offer student perspectives on using the model in the writing classroom to assess digital work. The student videos, along with my reflective analysis, evaluate the implementation of the assessment model. </p>


<h3>THE LANDSCAPE OF NEW MEDIA ASSESSMENT</h3>
<p>
After several semesters of assessing new media compositions using a largely print-centric, product-oriented rubric, I knew I needed to develop a different approach, and so I turned to literature in writing studies and education to see what others were saying about assessing new media texts. First, I realized that a reframing of classroom writing assessment for new media must ground itself in a solid theory of writing assessment itself. Brian Huot (2009) developed a rhetorically sensitive theory of writing assessment and set of preliminary principles and procedures that, although not designed specifically with new media texts in mind, establish the necessity of assessment practices that are rhetorical in nature and sensitive to purpose, audience, and context. Huot’s (2009) five principles for a new theory and practice of writing assessment include that the assessment(s) be site-based, locally controlled, context-sensitive, rhetorically based, and accessible, focused not on “the ability to judge accurately a piece of writing or a particular writer but to be able to describe the promise and limitations of a writer working within a particular rhetorical and linguistic context” (p. 173). And while Huot (2009) established these principles as a first step in constructing a “new theoretical umbrella” for writing assessment, he also urged compositionists to “develop procedures with which to document and validate such assessment” at local levels (p. 171). 
</p>

<h3>THE MODEL I PROPOSE</h3>
<p>
The work of Allison (2009), Bearne (2009), and Neal (2011) provides composition instructors like me with much that is useful when thinking about how to assess new media compositions in the writing classroom. Building on the work of these three scholars, I join them in answering the call to develop new assessment frameworks, and I offer my own model for new media assessment (see Figure 1). The model uses and transforms elements from Allison’s (2009), Bearne’s (2009), and Neal’s (2011) frameworks as well as from other writing and literacy scholars such as Selber (2004) and illustrates what rhetorical assessment of digital texts that gives attention to both the how and the why of composing might look like. The model emphasizes both composition process and product, it involves students in assessing their work at multiple points, it introduces and adapts terminology to describe composing in new media environments, and it uses its form as one way to communicate its meaning.

<p>
The inner circle of the model represents composition product, assessed by instructor or students through looking at three criteria: first, fulfillment of purpose and direction to audience; second, the use of a multifaceted logic through consideration of layers of media; and third, the use of rhetorical and technical features for effect. I will discuss my rationale for choosing these three criteria below in further detail. The product itself is also assessed along with elements of the composition process, represented by the smaller circles on the outer ring. I use and adapt some of Allison’s (2009) labels for elements of the composition process, including participate, produce, and publish, and I add revise (instead of perfecting) and reflect. I have also designed my representation of the composition process in a circle with bi-directional arrows to represent the recursive nature of process, illustrating how students are free to move between stages in the composition process as they consider different aspects of the product in various and re-occurring orders.

<h3>ASSESSMENT IN ACTION: REFLECTION ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MODEL</h3>

<p>
I have used a version of this model to assess new media video compositions in three 200-hundred level professional writing courses in 2011 and 2012 at the University of Michigan. Each class has helped me consider ways to revise aspects of the model, such as the terminologies I chose to guide goal-setting, and I have also had the opportunity to interview students about their experiences with video composition in our course and with the assessment model in particular. Below, I include excerpts of these interviews, focusing first on former student Ryan Schechtman and the self and instructor assessments of his video composition. I look first to Ryan because his reflections illuminate the interwoven development of all three of Selber’s literacies—functional, critical, and rhetorical. Yet Ryan’s experience is only one example of how the assessment model I describe can be taken up and applied in the writing classroom; thus I also offer several additional videos that illustrate how various students thought about and used goal-setting and the assessment model as they composed. 
</p>

<p>
And as I myself consider the strengths and weaknesses of this assessment model and the ways I might revise it for future use, I realize that what began in an apprehensive moment as a search for new media assessment practices grounded in composition theory and responsive to students and the purposes and contexts of their writing has now become a representation of my pedagogy for new media composition. Embedded in the model is a rigorous composition process where students learn by doing and through collaborating.  I hope that readers will discuss the model with one another and with students, critique it, point out what is useful in it and what isn’t, change it, build on it, remediate it, and transform it for their local contexts. This kind of critical analysis and discussion between ourselves and our students is one important step on the way to reframing writing assessment for new media and for today’s composition.
