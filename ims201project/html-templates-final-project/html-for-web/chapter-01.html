<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<p>
Mobile technology has become more accessible than ever. Over the course of the existence of mobile communication devices, they have become easier and easier to use and have become more popular with the general public. Through the examination of the history of mobile technology, we can see how mobile phones started off as being almost exclusive to business professionals. As the technology developed, they became more popular with the general public, eventually evolving into the smartphone and launching a full cultural phenomenon. Everyone has been finding new uses for this new technology, from businessmen, to educators, to the general public. Mobile technology continues to evolve and will continue to increase in popularity and usability, becoming more effective at servicing the individual and professionals and the public alike will find new uses for this exciting, changing technology. </p>


<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>
In this day and age, the accessibility of mobile phones has never been greater. According to a recent survey on pewinternet.org (10), over 90% of American adults use cell phones now. This number has increased exponentially in recent years, with the number continuing to rise worldwide. This new accessibility is due largely in part to the extreme technological advances in phone hardware. The evolution of the modern cell phone is a truly remarkable story; shifting from transistor radios and walkie talkies, into the highly sophisticated smart phones we know and love today. Now, mobile hardware has become so advanced that mobile devices are almost as powerful as computers are. The constant evolution of mobile technology and increased usage show that mobile phones are now more accessible than ever, and will continue to be so into the future.  </p>

<p>
Businessinsider.com recently released a visual history of mobile technology. This history shows that the earliest mobile communication devices were seen back in 1938; portable AM radios that were used by soldiers to communicate. These devices weighed 25 pounds and had an effective range of up to 5 miles. Compare that to the devices the average person uses today; phones that can communicate instantly with anyone in the world, weighing less than half a pound, with a battery life that can last for days. The leaps and bounds seen in the mobile hardware sector are truly incredible. The first truly mobile phone was released in 1973, a large, heavy, block of a phone that weighed over two pounds and cost over $4000. At its release, the only mobile phone users were high powered business executives who needed to be in constant contact with their co-workers. The United States didn’t even really see a user base develop until 1988, when 1 in every 100 people had a mobile phone plan. (8) Still, the user base was starting to develop, and followed an exponential increase all the way to today. Phones got cheaper, smaller, and more user friendly as the technology improved. Processing speed increased, features improved, and soon enough, everyone wanted one. The infographic seen below details how mobile phone popularity has increased steadily over the years, while the cost of using a cell phone also decreased exponentially. This shows how phones have become more affordable and accessible, and will continue to do so into the future.

<p>
    The rising popularity of mobile technology eventually led to what is known today as the smartphone. These devices could make a phone call, access text messages, play music, browse the internet, play games, and read and send e-mails. Some say the first true smart phones were pioneered by BlackBerry. But, similarly to the original cell phones, BlackBerry only appealed to business executives. Their design wasn’t very user friendly, had a high learning curve, and cost more than standard phones. Users also weren’t aware of all the features included with the BlackBerry. Frankly, the phone wasn’t “cool” enough for the general public. Of course, this all changed when the iPhone was released and rocketed the smartphone to popularity. Apple almost singlehandedly made smart phones one of the most popular electronics on the market, skyrocketing mobile phone usage. The new user friendly interface, coupled with multiple features, easy app usage, and positive word of mouth made it an enticing choice for anyone, not just business professionals.

    <p>
        While the “cool” factor may have been what really popularized mobile phones, the vast, varied amount of features included on smart phones is what made people customers for life. Ease of use of these features is what really began to draw customers in. A recent study published in the Journal of Information Systems discovered that “Ease of use is now becoming more of a basic factor than a point of differentiation” (3). Easy to use smartphones are becoming the standard, and continue to widen the customer base for these products and increasingly make mobile technology more accessible than ever before. </p>
<h3>
Applications
</h3>

<p>
Mobile technology has also vastly improved for business professionals; as the hardware improved, new applications for mobile phones were developed. Businesses could now have their employees access their ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) from anywhere, allowing them to update data within the system at any time. This made communication almost instant for any employee, anywhere in the world. They could look at their phones, access the corporate database, and be up to date on whatever would be happening within the company at any given time. This made communication much more efficient; data transfers that would normally take days at a time could then be done instantly. This effectively cut down on the amount of error throughout the company, specifically in the bookkeeping and accounting department. The retail side of a company would be able to flawlessly communicate their demand with the manufacturing side, allowing them to easily prepare for that day’s production accordingly. Before, this process could take a day or two, resulting in inadequate or unnecessary production. Now, it can be done instantly, with little to no confusion over what is required. This is just one example, but advancements in mobile technology has vastly improved the business workplace and will continue to innovate corporate structure in the years to come.</p>
    <p>
        Mobile technology is also being used effectively for educational purposes. Schools across the country are beginning to embrace mobile technology, specifically iPads, for educational usage. Mobile technology has created what teachers are referring to as "mobile-enhanced inquiry-based learning" (9). It’s a type of education style that encourages experimentation and query. While the use of mobile technology for education is relatively new, so far it has had very positive results. One of the ways mobile technology has been implemented in classrooms is the creation of interactive textbooks. These textbooks combine writings from experts with interactive activities, catering to different learning styles through the use of games, interactive activities, and videos. The hardware platforms, combined with innovative new hardware allows for anyone to easily pick up a device and have it cater to their educational needs. </p>
    <p>
        Mobile phones accessibility makes it easy for anyone to use them, not just students and professionals. The popular phrase “there’s an app for that,” while a little over the top, makes a statement that phones can solve any problem that the average person may have. The computing power within the average smart phone is strong enough that it can power most apps to solve most problems. A popular myth regarding smartphones is that the average phone today has more computing power than the computers on the original NASA space flights. Whether that is true or not, one can’t argue that modern smartphones are extremely versatile, powerful machines. Just browsing the app store on an iPhone, you can find apps that can do almost anything. Between video games, instructional apps, exercise monitors, social media apps, and many other types, mobile phones have become machines that can solve almost any problem and serve every need. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Overall, mobile technology is an extremely exciting, powerful technology that will continue to develop. The development of new hardware creates stronger, faster phones that will continue to advance the industry. These new devices will innovate business, education, general usage, and any other fields that these new technologies can be applied to. There are many exciting predictions of where the technology is headed. Soon, we may not need to carry wallets, as all our money and personal information could be stored in our phones. They may be able to constantly monitor our vital signs, sending out an emergency message as soon as a medical emergency occurs. Eventually, we may not even need phones. The technology is advancing at such a rapid pace that in the next few decades, we could see devices so small that they would not be noticeable. We would be able to privately communicate, access data, play games, and so much more, all instantly and effortlessly. The evolution of mobile technology makes for a great story, but it isn’t over yet. The future looks very exciting, and if mobile technology continues to evolve at the same rapid pace, mobile technology could make our wildest dreams come true.
